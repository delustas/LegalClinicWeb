QUICK INSTALL
__________________________________________

For the impatient, here is a basic outline of the installation process, which normally takes me only a few minutes:

1) Move the LegalClinicWeb files into your web directory.

2) Create a single database for LegalClinicWeb to store all its tables in (or choose an existing database).

3) Visit your LegalClinicWeb site with a browser, you should be taken to the install.php script, which will lead you through creating a config.php file and then setting up LegalClinicWeb, creating an admin account etc.

Good luck and have fun!
